Docker image can be used to run jax code with a GPU installation in a stable way.
These are instructions on how to build such an image on NERSC.

1. Go to Docekerfile and add any packages that you may need to the pip install.

2. From this directory run: 
    $ podman-hpc build --net=slirp4netns -t ubuntumpich:1.0 .
    $ podman-hpc tag ubuntumpich:1.0 jrobnik/sampling:1.0
    $ podman-hpc login docker.io
    $ podman-hpc push jrobnik/sampling:1.0

    You can swap "jrobnik/sampling:1.0" for your custom name of the image.
    For the third line you will need a docker account.

3. You can then download the image on the machine where you want to run it:
    $ shifterimg pull jrobnik/sampling:1.0
